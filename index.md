## News

I am recruiting Research Interns (PhD candidates) to join my research project @ Alibaba DAMO Academy. If you are interested in computer vision, especially transformer-based applications, and happens to be interested in Alibaba, please contact me.

## Biography

I am a senior algorithm engineer at DAMO Academy, Alibaba Group (U.S.) Inc. Before I joined Alibaba Group, I worked as a researcher at [Motovis Inc.](http://www.motovis.cn/) I received my Ph.D in Computer Science from [University of Wollongong](https://www.uow.edu.au/), Australia, in Oct. 2017, supervised by A/Prof. [Wanqing Li](https://sites.google.com/view/wanqingli/home-news) and Prof. [Philip Ogunbona](https://documents.uow.edu.au/~philipo/).  I received  my M.E. in Information and Communication Engineering from [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm), China, in 2013, supervised by Prof. [Yonghong Hou](http://seea.tju.edu.cn/info/1122/2098.htm), and B.E. in Network Engineering from [Nanchang University](http://english.ncu.edu.cn/), China, in 2010.
